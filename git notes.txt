1. pull latest changes from git
git pull origin master



If you want remove all local changes from your working copy, simply stash them:

git stash save --keep-index

If you don't need them anymore, you now can drop that stash:

git stash drop

If you want to overwrite only specific parts of your local changes, there are two possibilities:

   Commit everything you don't want to overwrite and use the method above for the rest.
   Use git checkout path/to/file/to/revert for the changes you wish to overwrite. Make sure that file is not staged via git reset HEAD path/to/file/to/revert.

2. push changes to git

git add .
git commit -m "Add existing file"

git push origin master
